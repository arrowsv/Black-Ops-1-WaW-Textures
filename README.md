# Installation
> [!WARNING]
> Avoid running the Converter or the "Convert All" option within Asset Manager if you choose the first installation option, as files you don't have GDTs for will be deleted.

There are two options for downloading the collection:
* I only want to use the assets (~700 MB size):
  1. Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/arrowsv/Black-Ops-1-WaW-Textures/releases) page and download the latest release.
  2. Extract the downloaded zip file into your main Black Ops 1 game directory.

* I want to use the assets and have the source files (~4 GB size):
  1. Above the list of files on the repo's main page, click the `Code` button and click `Download ZIP`.
  2. Extract the downloaded zip file into your main Black Ops 1 game directory, excluding the README.md and LICENSE files.
