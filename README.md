# Black-Ops-1-DLC-Models
A collection of every missing DLC model from the Black Ops Mod Tools. Use on top of an installation from Mythical's [Black Ops Mod Tools Installer](https://github.com/Mythical-Github/Black-Ops-Mod-Tools-Installer) to ensure all models missing from this collection are present. Additionally, use alongside the [Black Ops 1 Stock Models](https://github.com/arrowsv/Black-Ops-1-Stock-Models) collection to add missing base game models.

# Installation
> [!CAUTION]
> A majority of the materials and xmodels within this collection were compiled by guessing their properties. I've tried my hardest to match the properties as closely as possible to the original in-game models, although they will never be exact.
>
> Replacing existing files is recommended for full installation, and it may overwrite any already compiled material and xmodel files.

> [!WARNING]
> If you choose the first option, avoid running the Converter or the "Convert All" option within Asset Manager, as these will delete files you don't have GDTs for.

There are two options for downloading the collection:
* I only want to use the assets (~1 GB size):
  1. Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/arrowsv/Black-Ops-1-DLC-Models/releases) page and download the latest release.
  2. Extract the downloaded zip file into your main Black Ops 1 game directory.

* I want to use the assets and have the source files (~10 GB size):
  1. Above the list of files on the repo's main page, click the `Code` button and click `Download ZIP`.
  2. Extract the ZIP file into your main Black Ops 1 game directory. This file is 9+ GB in size as it contains all original image files in .TGA format alongside .XMODEL_EXPORT files.

# Todo
